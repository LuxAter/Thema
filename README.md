## About the Project

There are hundreds of different color schemes, and for an equally large number of
different programs. Thema, does not aim to add to any of this, but instead to
create a single tool that can be used to use the different themes that are
available.

Thema is a single bash script, which can be executed entirely in a single line,
no need to download or clone anything. The collection of themes, and application
configurations that are stored in this repository define the themes, variants
and outputs that Thema can produce. The script, attempts to detect which
programs are currently installed/configured on your system, and then it injects
the theme configuration into the programs configuration, or files. Then after
all configurations have been updated, a set of commands are executed, to apply
the updates to the system.

## Usage

To use Thema, simply run
```console
foo@bar:~$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuxAter/Thema/master/thema | bash -s -- --help
